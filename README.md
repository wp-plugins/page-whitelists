Wordpress plugin limiting user access to pages. Allows administrators to create whitelists and assigning them to either single users, or roles, and set if users are allowed to create new pages or not.

## Description

Page Whitelists is an administration tool that can be used to allow selected users to edit only certain pages, leaving the rest inaccessible. This is done by creating "whitelists", and assigning them to users and/or roles. Each whitelist can also limit creation of new pages.Every page, user and role can belong to multiple whitelists. 

#### Combining whitelists:
*  Whitelists are additive - every user has access to all pages in all whitelists they're assigned to.
*  'Strict' whitelists have priority - once a user is assigned to a whitelist that disables creation of new pages, they are not allowed to do so (even if other whitelists are 'non-strict').

#### Known problems/conflicts

* Page list generated by the Tree View plugin is not filtered (and thus displays restricted pages).
* Page Whitelist accidentally blocks loading of the pop-up dialog of the Nextgen Gallery plugin.

I'm working on these issues, they should be fixed for the next major release (e.g. 2.0)
