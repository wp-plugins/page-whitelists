the tables are driving me craycray
==================================

Needed: four tables 
	group data - id, name, date of creation
	whitelist data - id, name, date of creation, priority?, strict?
	group+user - user id, group id
	whitelist+group - whitelist id, group id
	
user does this:
	opens settings page
	creates a whitelist - name, pages (manually or automatically by category/tag) -- some multi select field
	creates a group - name, members (one by one or automatically add every member of a given role) -- add field to user creation page where you can add user to a group? (instead connecting it to roles...)
	assign whitelist to group
	--
	add new user to existing group
	assign new whitelist to existing group (when creating? where is the assignment done? on the whitelist page, or on the group page?)


create the table on installing the plugin, if it doesn't exist
add/remove/edit a whitelist
add/remove a page to whitelist
add/remove/edit a group
add/remove a whitelist to group
add/remove a user to group

options pages
	groups
	whitelists
	(settings? - rules for combining whitelists)
	
add to whitelist
	on edit-pages
	on page creation
	
add to group
	on user edit page
	on user creation
	
	
	
potentionally "classifiable" stuff:
	user authorization (the thing that checks if user is allowed on a page
	maintaining the list of allowed pages for a user
	options (options pages, updating, creation)
	
	
	
Table TO-DO
-----------

write add/remove functions
come up with a way to make sure there are no orphans (on deleting a page delete all it's references in wl tables and so on
